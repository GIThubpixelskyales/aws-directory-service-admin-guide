# AWS Managed Microsoft AD Prerequisites<a name="ms_ad_getting_started_prereqs"></a>

To create a AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, you need a VPC with the following: 
+ At least two subnets\. Each of the subnets must be in a different Availability Zone\.
+ The following ports must be open between the two subnets that you deploy your directory into\. This is necessary to allow the domain controllers that AWS Directory Service creates for you to communicate with each other\. A security group will be created and attached to your directory to enable communication between the domain controllers\.
  + TCP/UDP 53 \- DNS
  + TCP/UDP 88 \- Kerberos authentication
  + UDP 123 \- NTP
  + TCP 135 \- RPC
  + UDP 138 \- Netlogon
  + TCP/UDP 389 \- LDAP
  + TCP/UDP 445 \- SMB
  + TCP 636 \- LDAPS \(LDAP over TLS/SSL\)
  + TCP/UDP 464 \- Kerberos password change/set
  + TCP 3268 \- Global Catalog
  + TCP 3269 \- Global Catalog SSL
+ The VPC must have default hardware tenancy\.
+ You cannot create a AWS Managed Microsoft AD in a VPC using addresses in the 198\.18\.0\.0/15 address space\.
+ AWS Directory Service does not support using Network Address Translation \(NAT\) with Active Directory\. Using NAT can result in replication errors\.

If you need to integrate your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain with an existing on\-premises Active Directory domain, you must have the functional level for your on\-premises domain set to Windows Server 2003 or higher\.

## Multi\-factor Authentication Prerequisites<a name="prereq_mfa_ad"></a>

To support multi\-factor authentication with your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory, you must configure either your on\-premises or cloud\-based [Remote Authentication Dial\-In User Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS) \(RADIUS\) server in the following way so that it can accept requests from your AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory in AWS\.

1. On your RADIUS server, create two RADIUS clients to represent both of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain controllers \(DCs\) in AWS\. You must configure both clients using the following common parameters \(your RADIUS server may vary\):
   + **Address \(DNS or IP\)**: This is the DNS address for one of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD DCs\. Both DNS addresses can be found in the AWS Directory Service Console on the **Details** page of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD directory in which you plan to use MFA\. The DNS addresses displayed represent the IP addresses for both of the AWS Managed Microsoft AD DCs that are used by AWS\.
**Note**  
If your RADIUS server supports DNS addresses, you must create only one RADIUS client configuration\. Otherwise, you must create one RADIUS client configuration for each AWS Managed Microsoft AD DC\.
   + **Port number**: Configure the port number for which your RADIUS server accepts RADIUS client connections\. The standard RADIUS port is 1812\.
   + **Shared secret**: Type or generate a shared secret that the RADIUS server will use to connect with RADIUS clients\.
   + **Protocol**: You might need to configure the authentication protocol between the AWS Managed Microsoft AD DCs and the RADIUS server\. Supported protocols are PAP, CHAP MS\-CHAPv1, and MS\-CHAPv2\. MS\-CHAPv2 is recommended because it provides the strongest security of the three options\.
   + **Application name**: This may be optional in some RADIUS servers and usually identifies the application in messages or reports\.

1. Configure your existing network to allow inbound traffic from the RADIUS clients \(AWS Managed Microsoft AD DCs DNS addresses, see Step 1\) to your RADIUS server port\.

1. Add a rule to the Amazon EC2 security group in your AWS Managed Microsoft AD domain that allows inbound traffic from the RADIUS server DNS address and port number defined previously\. For more information, see [Adding Rules to a Security Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html#adding-security-group-rule) in the *EC2 User Guide*\.
