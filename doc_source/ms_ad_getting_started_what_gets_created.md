# What Gets Created<a name="ms_ad_getting_started_what_gets_created"></a>

When you create a directory with AWS Managed Microsoft AD, AWS Directory Service performs the following tasks on your behalf:
+ Automatically associates an elastic network interface with each of your domain controllers\. Each of these network interfaces are essential to preserve connectivity between EC2 and AWS Directory Service and should never be deleted\. You can identify all network interfaces reserved for use with AWS Directory Service by the description: "AWS created network interface for directory *directory\-id*"\. For more information, see [Elastic Network Interfaces](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide\.
+ Sets up Active Directory within the VPC running on two domain controllers for fault tolerance and high availability\. If you need more domain controllers, you can add them later\. For more information, see [Deploy Additional Domain Controllers](ms_ad_deploy_additional_dcs.md)\.
+ Creates an AWS Security Group that establishes network filters for traffic in and out of your domain controllers\. The default outbound filters permit all traffic to any destination\. The default inbound filter allows only traffic through ports that are required by Active Directory from any source\. Because you should never connect your VPC directly to the Internet, traffic to the domain controllers is limited to traffic from other computers in your VPC or from other VPCs or on\-premises networks that you have connected using VPC peering, AWS Direct Connect, or a Virtual Private Network connection\. Use extreme caution if you attempt to change these as you may break your ability to communicate with your domain controllers\. For more information about port requirements, see [AWS Managed Microsoft AD Prerequisites](ms_ad_getting_started_prereqs.md)\.
+ Creates a directory administrator account with the user name Admin and the specified password\. This account is located under the Users OU \(For example, Corp > Users\)\. You use this account to manage your directory in the AWS Cloud\. For more information, see [Admin Account](ms_ad_getting_started_admin_account.md)\.
**Important**  
Be sure to save this password\. AWS Directory Service does not store this password, and it cannot be retrieved\. However, you can reset a password from the AWS Directory Service console or by using the [ResetUserPassword](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/devguide/API_ResetUserPassword.html) API\.
+ Creates the following three organizational units \(OUs\) under the domain root:
